## Overall 
### Motivation
![Alt text][./figures/Intro.png)  
Multimedia content carried in a network packet or storage sector can be seen as a “fragment”. Multimedia systems generally deliver/store a collection of multiple media sources, e.g., text, audio, image, and video in a fragment-by-fragment manner. Therefore, the variety of media types requires multimedia file fragment classification (MFFC), especially in unreliable communication channels and corrupted storage devices for cyber security and digital forensics. An accurate MFFC enables a more resilient multimedia system against channel errors and storage corruption.
